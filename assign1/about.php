                <li>PHP version in Mercury: <?php echo phpversion(); ?>.</li>
                <li>I have attempted to complete all the tasks.</li>
                <li>I have code in the Post Job Form which allow users to enter Closing Date in both format
                    dd/mm/yy and d/m/yy to minimize errors while inputting data.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I did not participate in the discussion board for Assignment 1 because I did not have enough time to do so.
                    I am having an internship position as well as this course this semester. I just have a little time left after I complete my works during
                    internship and I also completed this assignment just in time.
                    Therefore, I hope I may be considered for not having participated in the discussion.</li>
